# Hexagonal anti-prism hammock Stand
A thing by hacks'r'us
## We (ok, mostly mikechislett) want one, and we have wants for it.
We wanted a bigger thing for having lots of hammocks in, and we wanted a weird shape.
* has to be big
* has to hold like, 6 or more (is better) hammocks
* * decent ish hammock hang distance is 8-15 feet
* has to have ZERO right-angles
* has to be an adventure to make
* ...but has to be possible
* low assembly complexity
  * So many identical parts is a win
  * fast to assemble (no domeV1 incidents plz)
* standard bulk materials
* open(read awesome) source
* needs to hold LX stuff
* extendable if reasonable


## Thinkings and doings
* scaffolding poles are many
* scaffolding poles are cheap
* scaffolding comes in 3 and 6 meter lengths
* hexagonal antiprisms are weird
* they have many sticks
* many sticks means many hammock points
* ofc, there are no decent clamps or arrangements of clamps that get the angles and regularity we need
* oh no, need to cast them
  * casting commercially is expensive
  * can we cast them?
  * oh its doable
  * lost pla casting aluminium is a thing
  * print thing, plaster thing, melt thing, cast thing
  * oh well, time to buy a furnace
  * maths. CAD angles, ouch my soul.
  * OH MY GEODESICS THE PRINT TIME IS LONG
  * get bigger nozzles.
  * remember to get furnace.
 * oh look aluminium bulk ingot near you.
 * need to buy protective coatings for the aluminium
 * oh yeah, and the human while casting.
 * ...TBC.
